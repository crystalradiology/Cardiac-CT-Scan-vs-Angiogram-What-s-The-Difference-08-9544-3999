# Cardiac-CT-Scan-vs-Angiogram-What-s-The-Difference-08-9544-3999
Medical imaging has revolutionised the way we detect and treat heart disease. With today’s technology, doctors can now view detailed pictures of the heart and blood vessels before symptoms become severe. Two of the most common imaging tests for evaluating heart health are the Cardiac CT scan and the CT angiogram. While both tests provide valuable insights, they serve different purposes. Understanding these differences can help patients make more informed decisions about their heart care.

At Butler Medical Imaging, we provide both of these advanced services with the highest quality care and professionalism. This article will help you understand the differences between these procedures and how they play a crucial role in your heart health journey.

What Is a Cardiac CT Scan?
A Cardiac CT scan, sometimes referred to as a heart CT or cardiac computed tomography, is a non-invasive imaging test that captures detailed cross-sectional images of the heart and its surrounding structures. Using X-ray beams and a special CT scanner, this procedure allows doctors to see the size, shape, and condition of your heart in great detail.

A Cardiac CT scan Service in Butler is a safer, less invasive alternative for many patients compared to traditional catheter angiograms. It is commonly used to:

·         Detect congenital heart defects.

·         Assess heart valve function.

·         Evaluate the size and structure of the heart chambers.

·         Monitor heart muscle condition.

·         Identify early signs of coronary artery disease.

·         Sometimes, contrast dye may be used to enhance the images, but it’s not always required.

What Is a CT Angiogram?
A CT angiogram (computed tomography angiography) is a more focused type of scan designed specifically to evaluate the blood vessels, including the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle. It combines a standard CT scan with a special contrast dye that is injected into a vein, usually in the arm. This dye highlights the arteries, helping doctors detect blockages, narrowing, or other abnormalities that can affect blood flow.

CT angiograms are particularly useful for diagnosing conditions like:

·         Coronary artery disease (CAD)

·         Blood clots

·         Aneurysms (abnormal bulging of blood vessels)

·         Vascular malformations

Key Differences Between the Two
Although both scans use similar CT technology, their functions and diagnostic goals differ:

Feature      

Cardiac CT Scan      

Purpose: Evaluates heart anatomy (chambers, valves, heart muscle).

Use of Contrast Dye: May or may not use contrast dye

Focus: General heart health assessment

Invasiveness: Non-invasive

Common Uses: Structural heart problems, congenital defects, and heart screening

CT Angiogram

Purpose: Focuses on blood vessels and blood flow

Use of Contrast Dye: Requires contrast dye

Focus: Detection of blockages and vascular issues

Invasiveness: Non-invasive but involves intravenous contrast

Common Uses: Chest pain, suspected coronary artery disease, blood clots

Which Test Is Right for You?
Choosing between a Cardiac CT scan and a CT angiogram depends largely on your symptoms and what your doctor needs to investigate.

·         You might be referred for a Cardiac CT scan if:

·         You have a congenital heart defect.t

·         There’s a need to examine the heart structure or muscle function.

·         You are undergoing a routine heart health screening.

On the other hand, a CT angiogram might be recommended if:

·         You are experiencing unexplained chest pain.in

·         You have risk factors for coronary artery disease (e.g. high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes)

·         Your doctor suspects a narrowing or blockage in your coronary arteries
